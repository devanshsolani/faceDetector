# faceDetector
Detects your face using OpenCV
1. Open CMD, write the command- 1. pip install opencv
                                2. pip install cv2
2. Check the path where cv2 has been installed. For my system, it is located at C:\Users\solan\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Lib\site-packages\cv2
3. Dont forget to type r before the path as you only want to read the file. Not doing this will throw an error. r'C:\Users\solan\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Lib\site-packages\cv2
4. Locate haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcascade_smile.xml if you dont find the path for CV2.
